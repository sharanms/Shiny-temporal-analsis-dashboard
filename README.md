# Shiny-temporal-analsis-dashboard

Hi there,

Here is an example of a somple dashboard with plots made in R.
For a quick view into what it looks like , check out https://sharanms.shinyapps.io/insnapdb5


Now for obvoius reasons I cannot expose the underlying data for generating the dashboard. 
But the R code shoudl give you a sneak peak into a bunch of things like
 - Spatial Denssity estimation
 - Tempora Trends and how best to make them user custom
 - Simple Dashboard metrics display 
 - Really cool ggplot2 features and more ...

You can always build on the dashboard, and have it include more interactive plots, heatmaps, ML viz etc.

"shiny" it up!
